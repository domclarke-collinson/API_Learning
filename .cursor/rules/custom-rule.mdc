## Development Workflow

Always run the following commands at the end of each prompt to ensure code quality and functionality:

1. `npm run start:dev` - Start development server
2. `npm run build` - Build the application
3. `npm run lint` - Run ESLint checks
4. `npm run test` - Run test suite
5. `npm run type-check` - Run TypeScript type checking

## Rules

- If any of these commands fail, fix the issues before considering the task complete
- All commands must run successfully without errors
- Address linting issues, test failures, and type errors immediately
- Ensure the development environment is properly configured
- Verify all tests pass and code quality standards are met

## Documentation Requirements

- **ALWAYS update relevant READMEs and documentation** after making changes
- Update main `README.md` if changes affect overall project functionality
- Update module-specific READMEs (e.g., `src/app/modules/http/README.md`) for module changes
- Ensure documentation accurately reflects the current state of the codebase
- Include usage examples for new features or changed functionality
- Update API documentation if endpoints or decorators are modified
- **In ask mode: Always provide comprehensive documentation updates as text for manual implementation**

## Code Quality Standards

- Follow ESLint rules and fix all warnings/errors
- Maintain 100% test coverage where possible
- Ensure TypeScript types are correct
- Follow the established code patterns in the project
- Keep the development server running without issues
- **Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes**
